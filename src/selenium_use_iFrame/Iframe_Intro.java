		//Displaying a webpage as a part of a another webpage is known as iframe. 
		//Iframe will be created by using tagname iframe.
//		Procedure to handle iframeü°™ To handle iframe we need to switch selenium focus 
		//from main page to frame by using 
		
//		driver.switchTo(). frame("String Name or Id‚Äù)
		
//		We can switch to frame by 3 ways- i.e. id or name, index, or Webelement
//		Once action perform on elements present on  iframe, selenium will not navigate to
		//main page by default.
		
//		To navigate from iframe to main we need use method like parent or default 
		//content.
//		Driver.switchTo.parentframe(); ‚Üí Child frame to immediate parent
//		Driver.switchTo.defaultcontent (); ‚Üí Child frame to main page
