		//primitive casting and non- primitive casting
		
		//*primitive casting -->3types 
		//1.implicit casting --> converting lower data type into higher data type...int-->long
		//it is also called as widening casting & memory size goes on increasing & there is no loss of data 
		//eg-->short-->long
		
		//explicit casting -->converting higher data type of info into lower data type 
		//it is also called as narrowing casting 
		//in which memory size goes on decresing 
		// loss of data takes place
		
		//*Non primitive casting -->converting 1 type of info into another type 
		//2 types -->1]Upcasting  2]Dowm casting 
		//1]UP-Casting -->Assining subclass properties to the superclass ,before performing upcasting operation 
		//we have to perform inhertiance operation where subclass inherits the properties of superclass
		//and in subclass user can declare its own properties 
		//but while performing upcasting the properties which are inheritated from the superclass are only eligible 
		//for the upcasting operation 
		//The new property which was declared inside subclass are not eligible for
		// up-casting operation.
		
		//2] down casting:
		//Assigning super class property into subclass is called down casting, before performing down 
		//casting 1st we need to perform up casting.
